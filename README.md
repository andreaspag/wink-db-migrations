MySQL DB versioning in PHP Application
========

This is a tool, which help us on day to day development in our office. 

Hopefully this will be useful for you as well.

Newest Zend Framework version (1.11.11) was used as the example application, but lower versions should work as well.

Updates and improvements are more than welcome!
